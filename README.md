# Genetic Circuit Design and Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and optimizing genetic circuits, specifically AND and OR gates, using computational and synthetic biology tools. The circuits are designed to simulate biosensing in *E. coli*, producing specific outputs based on given chemical inputs (AHL and Benzoate). 

## Key Features
- **Verilog Logical Gate Representations**: AND and OR gates encoded as digital logic in Verilog.
- **SBOL Generation**: Conversion of logic gates to SBOL (Synthetic Biology Open Language) format for compatibility with bio-design platforms.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Random Forest models for parameter prediction.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Optimization of circuit parameters to achieve desired biological functionality.
- **Promoter Mapping**: Integration of real-world biological promoters to match circuit requirements.
- **ODE Simulation**: Simulations to model gene expression and output fluorescence.
